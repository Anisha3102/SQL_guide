# How do you use BETWEEN, LIKE, and IN operators?

- These operators are used in the WHERE clause to filter results based on specific conditions.

## 1. BETWEEN Operator
### Purpose:
- Checks if a value lies within a range (inclusive).

### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```
### Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 60000;
```
- This returns employees with salary from 40000 to 60000, inclusive.

## 2. LIKE Operator
### Purpose:
Used for pattern matching in text data.

### Wildcards:
Symbol	Meaning
%	    Zero or more characters
_	    Exactly one character

### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern';
```
### Examples:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%';   -- Starts with 'A'

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE '%son'; -- Ends with 'son'

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '_o_'; -- 3-letter names with 'o' in the middle
```
## 3. IN Operator
### Purpose:
Checks if a value is within a given list of values.

### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
```
### Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE first_name IN ('Alice', 'Bob');
```
- This returns employees whose first_name is either Alice or Bob.
