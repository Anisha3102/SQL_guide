# What is a stored procedure? How is it different from a function?

## Definition
A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of SQL statements (and optional control flow logic) stored in the database.
It can accept parameters, perform operations, and return results â€” helping to reuse logic without rewriting queries.

## Why Use Stored Procedures?
Performance: Precompiled and stored in the database, so execution is faster.

Reusability: Can be called multiple times from different programs.

Security: Helps control access by granting execution rights without exposing the underlying tables.

Maintainability: Centralized logic that can be modified in one place.

## Example
```sql
-- Creating a stored procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDept
    @DeptName NVARCHAR(50)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
    FROM Employees
    WHERE department = @DeptName;
END;

-- Executing the procedure
EXEC GetEmployeesByDept 'HR';
```
## Difference Between Stored Procedure and Function

| **Feature**           | **Stored Procedure**                                                         | **Function**                                                |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**           | Perform operations (can return data or just execute tasks).                  | Perform calculations and return a value.                    |
| **Return Type**       | Can return multiple values via output parameters or result sets.              | Must return a single value or a table.                       |
| **Parameters**        | Supports **IN**, **OUT**, and **INOUT** parameters.                           | Only supports **IN** parameters.                             |
| **Use in SQL Queries**| Cannot be directly used in `SELECT` statements.                               | Can be directly used inside `SELECT`, `WHERE`, etc.          |
| **Transaction Control**| Can contain transaction control statements (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`).  | Cannot contain transaction control statements.               |
| **Compilation**       | Compiled once and stored in the database.                                     | Compiled each time it is called (in most SQL systems).        |
| **Use Case**          | Complex business logic, multiple operations.                                  | Simple computations or returning derived data.               |
