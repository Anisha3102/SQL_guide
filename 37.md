# What is a composite key? How is it different from a compound key?

## Composite Key

- A composite key is a primary key that consists of two or more columns.

- Together, these columns uniquely identify each record in a table.

- Used when a single column is not sufficient for uniqueness.

## Example:

```sql CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    enrollment_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
```

- Here, neither student_id nor course_id alone is unique.

- But (student_id, course_id) together form the composite primary key.

## Compound Key

- The term compound key is sometimes used interchangeably with composite key, but technically:

- A compound key is any key that consists of two or more attributes (columns), whether primary or not.

- That means a compound key can be a candidate key (potential primary key), a foreign key, or even a unique key.

## Example:

- In the Enrollment table above:

- (student_id, course_id) is a composite primary key.

- The same set of columns can also be referred to as a compound key because it’s made of multiple attributes.

## Difference Between Composite Key and Compound Key
| Feature   | Composite Key                                   | Compound Key                                                   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition | A primary key made of 2+ columns.               | Any key (primary, candidate, unique, or foreign) made of 2+ columns. |
| Scope     | Always the primary key.                         | Broader — includes composite keys but also other multi-column keys. |
| Example   | PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)             | UNIQUE (email, phone) OR FOREIGN KEY (student_id, course_id)   |


## So:

#### Every composite key is a compound key,

#### But not every compound key is a composite key.
