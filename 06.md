# What are constraints in SQL?

### Constraints in SQL are rules applied to columns in a table to enforce data integrity, accuracy, and reliability. They ensure that the data stored in the database adheres to specific conditions and business rules.

## Common SQL Constraints
| Constraint    | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NOT NULL      | Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values                              |
| UNIQUE        | Ensures that all values in a column are different                          |
| PRIMARY KEY   | A combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each record       |
| FOREIGN KEY   | Ensures referential integrity by linking a column to another table          |
| CHECK         | Ensures that all values in a column meet a specific condition               |
| DEFAULT       | Assigns a default value if no value is specified during insertion           |


## Example
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 5),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Explanation:
- **PRIMARY KEY**: Uniquely identifies each student.

- **NOT NULL**: Name must be provided.

- **CHECK**: Age must be at least 5.

- **UNIQUE**: Email must be unique.

- **DEFAULT**: created_at will auto-fill with current timestamp if not provided.

## Why Use Constraints?
- Maintain data integrity

- Avoid invalid or duplicate entries

- Enforce business rules directly in the schema

- Improve data reliability and consistency
