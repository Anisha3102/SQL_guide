# What are triggers in SQL? When would you use them?

## Definition
A trigger in SQL is a special stored program that automatically executes (fires) in response to certain events on a table or view.
These events can be INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations.
Think of a trigger as a “reaction” to a change in the database — you set it up once, and it runs automatically.

## Types of Triggers
| **Trigger Type**        | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **BEFORE Trigger**      | Executes before the event occurs (used for validation or modification before data is inserted/updated). |
| **AFTER Trigger**       | Executes after the event occurs (used for auditing or logging changes).         |
| **INSTEAD OF Trigger**  | Used on views to perform custom actions instead of the default behavior.        |
| **Row-Level Trigger**   | Fires once for each row affected by the event.                                  |
| **Statement-Level Trigger** | Fires once per SQL statement, regardless of rows affected.                  |


## Syntax Example
```sql
-- Creating an AFTER INSERT trigger
CREATE TRIGGER trg_AfterInsert_Employee
ON Employees
AFTER INSERT
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO EmployeeAudit (employee_id, action, action_date)
    SELECT employee_id, 'INSERT', GETDATE()
    FROM inserted;
END;
```
## When to Use Triggers
- Auditing: Keep a log of changes made to important tables.

- Enforcing Business Rules: Automatically validate or modify data before saving.

- Cascading Actions: Automatically update or delete related records.

- Preventing Invalid Transactions: Roll back a change if certain conditions aren’t met.

- Synchronizing Tables: Keep data in multiple tables consistent.

## Advantages
- Automates repetitive tasks.

- Ensures certain rules are always enforced.

- Can centralize logic at the database level.

##  Disadvantages
- Can make debugging harder since they run automatically in the background.

- May impact performance if overly complex.

- Can cause unintended side effects if not carefully designed.
