# What are aggregate functions in SQL? (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)

## What are Aggregate Functions in SQL?
Aggregate functions in SQL perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. They are commonly used with the GROUP BY clause to summarize data across multiple rows.

## Common Aggregate Functions:
| Function | Description                              |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| COUNT()  | Counts the number of rows or non-NULL values |
| SUM()    | Returns the total sum of numeric values  |
| AVG()    | Calculates the average of numeric values |
| MAX()    | Returns the maximum (highest) value      |
| MIN()    | Returns the minimum (lowest) value       |


## Example Table: orders
| order_id | customer | amount |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 1        | Alice    | 1500   |
| 2        | Bob      | 2700   |
| 3        | Alice    | 1300   |
| 4        | David    | 900    |


## Examples of Aggregate Functions:
### 1. COUNT() — Number of Orders
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders;
```
- Result: 4 (total number of rows)

### 2. SUM() — Total Revenue
```sql
SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_revenue
FROM orders;
```
- Result: 6400 (1500 + 2700 + 1300 + 900)

### 3. AVG() — Average Order Value
```sql
SELECT AVG(amount) AS avg_order_value
FROM orders;
```
- Result: 1600 (6400 / 4)

### 4. MAX() — Largest Order Amount
```sql
SELECT MAX(amount) AS largest_order
FROM orders;
```
- Result: 2700

### 5. MIN() — Smallest Order Amount
```sql
SELECT MIN(amount) AS smallest_order
FROM orders;
```
- Result: 900

## Usage with GROUP BY:
We can combine aggregate functions with GROUP BY to calculate values per group:

```sql
SELECT customer, COUNT(*) AS orders_count, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer;
```
