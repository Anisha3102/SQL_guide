# How can you eliminate duplicate rows from a result set?

In SQL, we can eliminate duplicate rows from a result set using the DISTINCT keyword or by applying GROUP BY.

## 1. Using DISTINCT

- The most common and simple method:

```sql SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

- Ensures that only unique combinations of the selected columns appear.

- Works well when you want to remove duplicates across all selected columns.

## Example:

```sql SELECT DISTINCT name, course
FROM students;
```

- This removes duplicate (name, course) pairs.

## 2. Using GROUP BY

- Another way is to group rows by the columns you want unique values for:

```sql SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...;
```

- Groups identical rows together and returns one row per group.

- Useful when you also want to use aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, etc.).

## Example:

```sql SELECT name, course
FROM students
GROUP BY name, course;
```

## 3. Using ROW_NUMBER() (when you need to keep only one row among duplicates)

- If we want to keep only one record and eliminate duplicates based on certain columns:

```sql WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        name, course,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY name, course ORDER BY id) AS row_num
    FROM students
)
SELECT name, course
FROM cte
WHERE row_num = 1;
```

- ROW_NUMBER() assigns a unique number to duplicates.

- Filtering row_num = 1 keeps only the first occurrence.

## When to use what?

- Use DISTINCT → if we just want unique rows.

- Use GROUP BY → if we also need aggregates.

- Use ROW_NUMBER() → if we want more control over which duplicate to keep (e.g., based on latest date or highest salary).
