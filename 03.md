# What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clause

### 📊 Difference Between `WHERE` and `HAVING` Clause

| Feature              | WHERE Clause                                             | HAVING Clause                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Filters rows **before** grouping                         | Filters groups **after** grouping                          |
| **Used With**        | `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`                             | `SELECT` (must be used with `GROUP BY`)                    |
| **Aggregate Functions** | ❌ Cannot use aggregate functions (`SUM()`, `COUNT()` etc.) | ✅ Can use aggregate functions                              |
| **Execution Order**  | Executed **before** `GROUP BY`                           | Executed **after** `GROUP BY`                              |
| **Example Use Case** | Filter specific rows (e.g., `age > 30`)                 | Filter grouped records (e.g., `HAVING COUNT(*) > 5`)       |


### Example
## Using WHERE
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Orders
WHERE status = 'Delivered';
```
→ Filters rows where status is 'Delivered' before grouping or aggregation.

## Using HAVING
```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```
→ First groups rows by customer_id, then filters groups where the count is greater than 5.

## Summary
Use **WHERE** to filter rows before aggregation.

Use **HAVING** to filter groups after aggregation.
