# What is the difference between EXISTS, ANY, ALL, and IN?

## 1. EXISTS
- Purpose: Checks if a subquery returns at least one row.

- Returns: TRUE if the subquery result is non-empty, otherwise FALSE.

- Often used with: Correlated subqueries.

## Example:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.id
);
```
- Meaning: Select customers who have at least one order.

## 2. IN
- Purpose: Checks if a value matches any value in a list or subquery result.

- Returns: TRUE if value is found.

## Example:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Customers
WHERE country IN ('USA', 'UK', 'Canada');
```
- Meaning: Customers from USA, UK, or Canada.

## 3. ANY / SOME
> (SOME is a synonym for ANY in most SQL dialects.)

- Purpose: Compares a value to each value returned by a subquery and returns TRUE if the comparison is true for at least one value.

- Requires: A comparison operator (=, >, <, >=, <=, <>).

## Example:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Products
WHERE price > ANY (
    SELECT price
    FROM Products
    WHERE category = 'Electronics'
);
```
- Meaning: Products priced higher than at least one electronics item.

## 4. ALL
- Purpose: Compares a value to all values returned by a subquery and returns TRUE if the comparison is true for every value.

- Requires: A comparison operator.

## Example:

``` sql
SELECT name
FROM Products
WHERE price > ALL (
    SELECT price
    FROM Products
    WHERE category = 'Electronics'
);
```
- Meaning: Products priced higher than every electronics item.
