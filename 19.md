# What is the difference between IS NULL and = NULL?

- This is a very common SQL trap — understanding it is important for writing correct queries when dealing with missing or undefined values.

###  = NULL Does Not Work
### = NULL always returns unknown (NULL), not TRUE or FALSE.

- In SQL, NULL means "unknown" or "missing," and you cannot compare unknown values using = or !=.

```sql
-- This will NOT return any rows!
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary = NULL;
```
## Use IS NULL Instead
- IS NULL is the correct way to check for NULL values.

- It returns TRUE if the value is indeed NULL.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary IS NULL;
```
## Use IS NOT NULL to Check for Non-NULL Values
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary IS NOT NULL;
```
## Summary Table
| Expression        | Meaning                          | Returns |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------|
| `salary = NULL`   | Comparing with NULL              | ❌ Invalid (always NULL) |
| `salary IS NULL`  | Checks if value is NULL          | ✅ Correct |
| `salary IS NOT NULL` | Checks if value is NOT NULL  | ✅ Correct |
