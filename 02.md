## üìã SQL Statement Categories

| Category | Full Form                 | Purpose                                         | Examples                                  |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| DDL      | Data Definition Language  | Defines or alters structure of database objects | `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `RENAME`       |
| DML      | Data Manipulation Language| Handles data manipulation in tables             | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`    |
| DCL      | Data Control Language     | Controls permissions and access to data         | `GRANT`, `REVOKE`                          |
| TCL      | Transaction Control Language | Manages transactions to ensure data integrity | `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, `BEGIN` |

## üìå Detailed Examples

###  1. DDL ‚Äì Data Definition Language
Used to define or modify the structure of database objects.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

### 2. DML ‚Äì Data Manipulation Language
Used for working with the data inside tables.

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (1, 'Anisha', 50000);
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
### 3. DCL ‚Äì Data Control Language
Used for giving or taking back user permissions.

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user1;
REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM user1;
```
### 4. TCL ‚Äì Transaction Control Language
Used to manage the changes made by DML statements.

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE employees SET salary = 60000 WHERE id = 1;
COMMIT;
-- Or use ROLLBACK to undo
```
# Tip: Use TCL to ensure consistency when executing multiple related operations together.
