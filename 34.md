# What are the differences between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN?

| Feature     | INNER JOIN                                           | OUTER JOIN                                                                 |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition  | Returns only rows that have matching values in both tables. | Returns all rows from one or both tables, even if there’s no match.        |
| Matching    | Keeps only the intersection of two tables.           | Keeps the intersection plus unmatched rows (depending on LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL). |
| NULLs       | Does not include unmatched rows → unmatched data is excluded. | Includes unmatched rows → missing side is filled with NULLs.               |
| Types       | Only one type: INNER JOIN                            | Three types: LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN            |
| Result Set  | Smaller (only common data).                          | Larger (includes common + unmatched rows).                                 |
