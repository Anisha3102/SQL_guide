# What is the purpose of the GROUP BY clause?

- The GROUP BY clause is used in SQL to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, like totals or averages. 
- It is commonly used with aggregate functions such as COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), or MIN() to perform operations on each group of data.

## Key Points:

| Feature                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Usage                  | Groups rows that have the same value in one or more columns                 |
| Common with            | COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()                                         |
| Used after             | WHERE clause (if any) and before the ORDER BY clause                        |
| Cannot be used with    | Columns in SELECT that are neither grouped nor used in aggregate functions  |

## Example:
Table: Sales

| Region | Product | Revenue |
|--------|---------|---------|
| East   | A       | 100     |
| East   | B       | 150     |
| West   | A       | 200     |
| East   | A       | 50      |
| West   | B       | 300     |


## Query:

```sql
SELECT Region, SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Region;
```

## Result:

| Region | TotalRevenue |
|--------|--------------|
| East   | 300          |
| West   | 500          |


## When to Use:
- When we want to aggregate data (like totals or counts) per category.

- When we need to analyze trends or summarize information by group (e.g., total sales per region or average salary per department).
