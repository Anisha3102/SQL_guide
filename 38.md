# How do you perform pagination in SQL? (LIMIT, OFFSET)

- Pagination means retrieving a subset of rows from a result set instead of fetching all at once.

- This is typically done using LIMIT and OFFSET (in MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) or equivalents in other databases (e.g., TOP in SQL Server, FETCH NEXT in Oracle).

## 1. Using LIMIT and OFFSET

### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name
LIMIT page_size OFFSET (page_number - 1) * page_size;
```

- LIMIT n → how many rows to return (page size).

- OFFSET m → how many rows to skip before starting.

## Example (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite):
```sql
-- Get page 2, with 5 records per page
SELECT id, name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;
```

- Skips first 5 rows → returns rows 6–10.

## 2. Using LIMIT with Two Arguments (MySQL Shortcut)
```sql
SELECT id, name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 5, 5;
```

- First number = offset (skip).

- Second number = limit (fetch).

- Same as LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5.

## 3. Using ROW_NUMBER() (for SQL Server / Standard SQL)

- In databases that don’t support LIMIT + OFFSET (like SQL Server), we use window functions:
```sql
WITH numbered AS (
  SELECT id, name, salary,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) AS row_num
  FROM employees
)
SELECT id, name, salary
FROM numbered
WHERE row_num BETWEEN 6 AND 10;
```

- Fetches rows 6 to 10 (page 2, 5 records per page).

## 4. Using FETCH NEXT (SQL Server, Oracle 12c+)
```sql
SELECT id, name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY id
OFFSET 5 ROWS FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;
```

- Equivalent to LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5.

 ## Performance Notes

- OFFSET can be slow for large page numbers (because the DB still scans skipped rows).

- For better performance in big tables:

- Use keyset pagination (a WHERE id > last_seen_id approach).

## Example:
```sql
SELECT id, name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE id > 100
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 5;
```

- Faster because it avoids scanning skipped rows.
