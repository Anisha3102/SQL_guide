# What is a view? How is it different from a table?

## Definition

A view in SQL is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SELECT query.
It does not store data physically (except in materialized views); instead, it displays data stored in other tables.
Think of it as a saved query that can be treated like a table in queries.

## Why Use Views?
Security: Restrict access to specific columns/rows.

Simplification: Encapsulate complex queries for easy reuse.

Consistency: Provide a consistent interface even if underlying tables change.

Data Abstraction: Hide the complexity of joins and calculations.

## Syntax Example
```sql
-- Creating a view
CREATE VIEW EmployeeDetails AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department
FROM Employees
WHERE department = 'HR';

-- Using the view
SELECT * FROM EmployeeDetails;
```
## Difference Between View and Table

| **Feature**     | **Table**                                                                 | **View**                                                                |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Storage**| Stores data physically in the database.                                   | Does not store data physically (except materialized views).              |
| **Definition**  | A database object that holds actual data in rows and columns.             | A virtual table based on a query result.                                 |
| **Modification**| Can be directly modified (insert, update, delete) unless restricted by constraints. | Cannot always be modified; depends on the view definition.               |
| **Performance** | Faster for direct data operations since it holds data.                    | May be slower as it executes the underlying query each time.             |
| **Dependency**  | Independent database object.                                              | Dependent on one or more tables (or views).                              |
| **Use Case**    | Permanent storage of data.                                                | Presenting filtered or computed data for specific needs.                 |
