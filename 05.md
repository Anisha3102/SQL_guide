# What is a Foreign Key?

## A Foreign Key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the Primary Key in another table. It is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables and ensures referential integrity of the data.

## Key Points

| Feature             | Description                                                              |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose             | Creates a relationship between two tables                                |
| Points To           | Primary Key or Unique Key in the referenced table                        |
| Ensures             | Data consistency and integrity across related tables                     |
| Allows NULLs?       | Yes (unless explicitly restricted)                                        |
| Duplicates Allowed? | Yes (unlike Primary Key, which must be unique)                           |


## Example
```sql
-- Create parent table
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create child table with a foreign key
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Departments(dept_id)
);
```
### In this example:

- dept_id in Employees is a Foreign Key.

- It references dept_id in Departments.

- This ensures an employee must belong to an existing department.

## Benefits
- Maintains data integrity

- Helps in joining tables meaningfully

- Prevents orphan records (records that donâ€™t reference a valid parent)
