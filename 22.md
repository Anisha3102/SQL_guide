# What is indexing in SQL? What are the types of indexes?

## Definition
- Indexing in SQL is a database optimization technique that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table.
- An index works like the index of a book — instead of scanning the entire table (full table scan), the database can quickly locate the required rows using the index.

### Key point: Indexes make SELECT queries faster but can slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations because the index must also be updated.

## Why Indexing is Important
- Faster Query Performance: Reduces search time.

- Efficient Sorting: Speeds up ORDER BY and GROUP BY queries.

- Better Join Performance: Helps in joining large tables quickly.

Types of Indexes in SQL
| **Index Type**                       | **Description**                                                                                          | **Use Case**                                                        |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Index**                     | Automatically created when a primary key is defined. Ensures uniqueness of key values.                   | Identifying each row uniquely.                                      |
| **Unique Index**                      | Ensures all values in the indexed column are unique.                                                     | Enforcing uniqueness without making it a primary key.               |
| **Clustered Index**                   | Rearranges the table’s data rows in the order of the index key. Only one clustered index per table.       | Range queries, sorting, searching in large tables.                  |
| **Non-Clustered Index**               | Stores a separate structure from the table with pointers to the data rows. Multiple allowed per table.   | Searching in columns other than the primary key.                     |
| **Composite Index**                   | An index on two or more columns.                                                                         | Searching/filtering on multiple columns.                            |
| **Full-Text Index**                   | Special type for searching textual data efficiently.                                                     | Searching words


## Example
```sql
-- Creating a Non-Clustered Index
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_name 
ON Customers (customer_name);

-- Creating a Unique Index
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email_unique 
ON Users (email);
```
## Advantages of Indexing
- Speeds up data retrieval.

- Reduces disk I/O for queries.

- Helps in efficient sorting and filtering.

## Disadvantages
- Requires extra storage space.

- Slows down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

- Needs maintenance when data changes.
