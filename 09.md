# What is a NULL value in SQL? How is it handled in comparisons?

- In SQL, NULL represents a missing, unknown, or undefined value. It is not the same as 0, an empty string '', or a blank space.

## Key Characteristics of NULL
- NULL means no value has been assigned.

- A column can be declared to accept or reject NULL using the NOT NULL constraint.

- Any arithmetic operation or string concatenation with NULL results in NULL.

## How is NULL Handled in Comparisons?
| Comparison Type           | Behavior with NULL                                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `=` or `!=`               | Always returns unknown (`NULL`)                          |
| `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` | ✅ Correct way to check for `NULL` values                |
| Aggregate Functions       | Ignores `NULL` values by default                         |
| Sorting                   | `NULL`s are usually sorted last (or first, DB-dependent) |
| Joins                     | May cause mismatches if not explicitly handled           |



## Incorrect Comparison Example
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary = NULL;  -- ❌ Will not work
```
This always returns no rows, because NULL = NULL is not true, it's unknown.

## Correct Comparison Example
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary IS NULL;     -- ✅ Correct way
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary IS NOT NULL; -- ✅ Opposite check
```
## Important Note
Use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators for checking NULL values. Never use = NULL or != NULL.
