# What are ACID properties of a transaction?

## Definition
In SQL, a transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations executed as a single unit of work.
The ACID properties ensure that database transactions are reliable, consistent, and fault-tolerant.

## ACID Properties
| **Property**   | **Description**                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Atomicity**  | Ensures that a transaction is all-or-nothing — either all operations succeed, or none are applied. If one part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back. |
| **Consistency**| Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all rules, constraints, and relationships.                 |
| **Isolation**  | Ensures that transactions are executed independently — the intermediate results of one transaction are invisible to others until it is committed.       |
| **Durability** | Ensures that once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent, even in case of a system crash.                                               |


## Example
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts
SET balance = balance - 500
WHERE account_id = 1;

UPDATE Accounts
SET balance = balance + 500
WHERE account_id = 2;

COMMIT; -- All changes saved permanently
-- If any step fails, ROLLBACK will undo all changes.
```
## Summary 

| **Property**   | **Meaning**                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Atomicity**  | All operations in a transaction are completed, or none are.                 |
| **Consistency**| The database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.     |
| **Isolation**  | Transactions do not interfere with each other’s intermediate states.        |
| **Durability** | Once committed, changes survive power loss or system failure.               |
