# What is a DISTINCT keyword and when is it used?

## What is the DISTINCT Keyword in SQL?
The DISTINCT keyword is used in SQL to remove duplicate rows from the result set of a SELECT query. It ensures that the values returned are unique.

## Syntax:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

## When is it Used?
- We use DISTINCT when:
- We want to eliminate duplicate values from the result.
- We're analyzing data and only care about unique combinations.
- We want to get a list of unique values from a column.

## Example:
Given a Students table:
| id | name  | course  |
|----|-------|---------|
| 1  | Alice | Math    |
| 2  | Bob   | Math    |
| 3  | Alice | Science |
| 4  | Alice | Math    |


## Query:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name, course FROM Students;
```
## Output:
| name  | course  |
|-------|---------|
| Alice | Math    |
| Bob   | Math    |
| Alice | Science |


## Note: Without DISTINCT, the same "Alice - Math" combination would appear twice.
