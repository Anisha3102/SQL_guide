# What is SQL?

## SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. 

## It allows users to perform a wide range of operations on data stored in a database, such as:

- Creating and modifying database structures (tables, views, indexes)

- Inserting, updating, and deleting records

- Querying data using simple or complex criteria

- Controlling access to data with permissions

- SQL is supported by most relational database systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and SQLite.

## Example:

```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
```
SQL is declarative, meaning you specify what you want (e.g., retrieve data) rather than how to do it.
