# What are aliases in SQL? How do you use them?

#### In SQL, aliases are temporary names assigned to columns or tables in a query using the AS keyword . They make output more readable or simplify referencing complex expressions.

## Key Uses of Aliases
| Type   | Purpose                                                     |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Column | Rename column headers in the result set                     |
| Table  | Shorten table names for ease in queries (especially joins)  |


## Syntax
### Column Alias:
```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```
### Table Alias:
```sql
SELECT t.column_name
FROM table_name AS t;
```
- AS is optional â€” SELECT column_name alias_name also works.

## Example Table: employees
| id | first_name | last_name | salary |
|----|------------|-----------|--------|
| 1  | Alice      | Smith     | 50000  |
| 2  | Bob        | Johnson   | 60000  |


## Examples
### 1. Column Alias
```sql
SELECT first_name AS Name, salary AS Salary
FROM employees;
```
### Output:
| Name  | Salary |
|-------|--------|
| Alice | 50000  |
| Bob   | 60000  |


### 2. Table Alias
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.salary
FROM employees AS e;
```
### 3. Alias with Expressions
```sql
SELECT first_name, salary * 12 AS Annual_Salary
FROM employees;
```
## Why Use Aliases?
- Make output more readable

- Simplify query writing (especially joins)

- Rename computed or aggregated columns
