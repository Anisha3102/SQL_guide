# What is a Primary Key?


A **Primary Key** is a column (or a set of columns) in a table that **uniquely identifies each row** in that table.

---

## Key Features of a Primary Key

- **Uniqueness**: No two rows can have the same primary key value.
- **Not Null**: A primary key column **cannot have NULL values**.
- **One per table**: Each table can have **only one** primary key.
- **Indexed**: SQL automatically creates an **index** on the primary key for fast searching.

## Syntax to Define a Primary Key

### 1. **While Creating a Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);
```
## 2. **Composite Primary Key** (Multiple columns)
```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)
);
```
## 3. **Adding Primary Key to an Existing Table**
```sql
ALTER TABLE Students
ADD PRIMARY KEY (student_id);
```
> Primary Key Constraints
> We cannot insert duplicate or null values in a primary key column.
> Trying to do so will result in an error.

## Summary
A primary key = unique + not null.

It is used to identify records uniquely in a table.
