# What is the use of ORDER BY clause?

- The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set of a query by one or more columns, either in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

## Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC | DESC], column2 [ASC | DESC], ...;
```
## Key Points

| Feature           | Description                                                             |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Default Order     | ASC (ascending) is the default.                                          |
| Multiple Columns  | Can sort by multiple columns â€” priority is left to right.               |
| Used With         | Works with SELECT statements, including ones with WHERE, GROUP BY, etc. |
| Null Handling     | NULL values are sorted first or last, depending on DBMS.                |


ðŸ“Š Example Table: students

| id | name  | score |
|----|-------|-------|
| 1  | Alice | 85    |
| 2  | Bob   | 90    |
| 3  | Carol | 78    |
| 4  | Dave  | 90    |


## Examples
### 1. Sort by score in ascending order:
```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY score ASC;
```
### 2. Sort by score (descending), then by name (ascending):
```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY score DESC, name ASC;
```
## Use Case
When we want to present sorted results â€” like showing top-scoring students, earliest dates, or alphabetically ordered names.
