## What is Normalization in SQL?
#### Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to:

- Reduce data redundancy

- Improve data integrity

- Make the database more efficient and scalable

- It involves dividing large tables into smaller related ones and defining relationships between them.

## Objectives of Normalization:
- Eliminate repeating groups

- Store data logically and consistently

- Make data easier to maintain

## Types of Normal Forms
Below are the first three normal forms most commonly applied in database design:

# 1NF (First Normal Form)
 ## Rule:
- Each column should contain atomic (indivisible) values.

- No repeating groups or arrays.

- Each row must be unique.

## Example (Not in 1NF):
| student_id | name  | subjects             |
|------------|-------|----------------------|
| 1          | Alice | Math, Physics        |
| 2          | Bob   | Chemistry, Biology   |


 ## Problem: subjects column has multiple values.

## Converted to 1NF:
| student_id | name  | subject   |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| 1          | Alice | Math      |
| 1          | Alice | Physics   |
| 2          | Bob   | Chemistry |
| 2          | Bob   | Biology   |


# 2NF (Second Normal Form)
## Rule:
- Must be in 1NF

- No partial dependency: Non-key columns must depend on the entire primary key

- Applies to composite keys (multi-column primary keys)

## Example (Not in 2NF):
| student_id | course_id |
|------------|-----------|
| 1          | 101       |
| 2          | 102       |


## Problem: student_name depends only on student_id, and course_name depends only on course_id → partial dependencies

## Converted to 2NF:
Student's table

| student_id | student_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Alice        |
| 2          | Bob          |


Courses Table

| course_id | course_name |
|-----------|-------------|
| 101       | Math        |
| 102       | Physics     |


Enrollment Table

| student_id | course_id |
|------------|-----------|
| 1          | 101       |
| 2          | 102       |


# 3NF (Third Normal Form)
## Rule:
- Must be in 2NF

- No transitive dependency: Non-key columns must not depend on other non-key columns.

## Example (Not in 3NF):
| employee_id | name  | dept_id | dept_name |
|-------------|-------|---------|-----------|
| 1           | Alice | 10      | HR        |
| 2           | Bob   | 20      | Finance   |



## Problem: dept_name depends on dept_id, not on the primary key → transitive dependency

##  Converted to 3NF:
Employees Table
| employee_id | name  | dept_id |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| 1           | Alice | 10      |
| 2           | Bob   | 20      |



Departments Table

| dept_id | dept_name |
|---------|-----------|
| 10      | HR        |
| 20      | Finance   |


##  Summary Table:
| Normal Form | Rule                                   |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1NF         | Atomic columns, no repeating groups    |
| 2NF         | No partial dependency on primary key   |
| 3NF         | No transitive dependency on non-key columns |
