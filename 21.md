# What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?

| Feature            | UNION                                         | UNION ALL                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Duplicate Handling | Removes duplicate rows from the final result  | Includes all rows, even if they are duplicates |
| Performance        | Slower (due to sorting and duplicate removal) | Faster (no duplicate check)                   |
| Use Case           | When unique records are required              | When all records, including duplicates, are needed |
| Sorting            | Performs implicit sorting to remove duplicates| No implicit sorting is performed              |
| Output Size        | May return fewer rows                         | Returns total rows from all SELECTs combined  |
